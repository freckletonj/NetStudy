Motifs Project
-------------

In this little project we wanted to check the
- average number of concepts
- average sum of the concepts' small phi values
- average big phi (probably always 0 for most of the motifs, though)
of all the 13 possible 3 node motifs.

for the following 4 conditions:

1. No self loops (that is each node has at most 2 inputs and 2 outputs):
     a) only linear threshold mechanisms: two possibilities Threshold >=
1 (Copy/OR), Threshold >= 2 (AND)
         maybe only those nodes that actually have 2 inputs should be
ANDs (not sure about this one)
     b) same as a) with the possibility of XORs for those nodes that
actually have 2 inputs

2. All the nodes have self loops
     a) only linear threshold mechanisms: >= 1, >= 2, >= 3
     b) same as a) but with the possibility of XORs

Could be plotted as bar graphs labeled by the motif number as in the
Sporns & KÃ¶tter 2004 paper Fig. 1.


So this is very similar to what you did for all possible 4 node
networks, just that the network structure is constrained by each motif
and then the average should be for each motif. So there are much less
possibilities of different mechanisms for these motifs than for the 4
node networks.

So for example motif 4 ( A <-> B <- C) could under condition 1a) have B
either an AND or an OR, but A must be a Copy and C is actually a "Null"
node, so it doesn't have inputs. We'll assume that Null nodes always
switch off.

Let me know if you have questions and if you would like to start I'd
suggest you try condition 1a) and then talk to me about the results
before doing the rest.
Best,

With 3 possible nodes you should be able to do all possible (8) states of the 3 nodes.
And then yes the nodes in the motifs should have different mechanisms, for 1a) that would be ORs and Ands. All nodes with 2 inputs should equally often be ANDs and ORs (which should be the case automatically if you try all possible combinations) and all nodes with 1 input should be COPY's.

3 nodes, not more - gotcha, I just didn't want to hardcode all 13, and it took a similar amount of time to write the code that could generate arbitrary numbers of nodes, I just whipped it out this morning.

all 8 activation states - perfect

so to clarify, for each condition, I will calculate 1. num of concepts, 2. phi of concepts, 3. Phi of network. I will do this for all current_states across all possible combinations of AND and OR nodes (single connections are COPY), and XOR when the condition asks for it.

I guess this will boil down to 3 charts per condition (that can be overlaid) for each dependent variable.

3 plots per condition, would be average num concepts etc. against motif # 1-13.
